Fix flaky e2e test. Get first file in frontend/test/e2e/flaky (including subdirectories recursively), run it using run-playwright-test.sh script for all tests in that specific file. 

Fix first failing test in that test suite. If test is correct and application implementation is fault, write that as a comment to that test and make it skip instead of failure.
If all tests from that suite is successfull or skipped, move that file to /frontend/test/e2e

When completed
- there is no file under frontend/test/e2e/flaky directory (recursively)
- all e2e tests are passing or are skipped. No test is failing

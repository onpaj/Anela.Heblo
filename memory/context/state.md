# Project State

_Update this file at the end of significant sessions._

## Project Summary

**Anela Heblo** — cosmetics company workspace app. Monorepo: .NET 8 backend + React frontend. Single Docker image deployed to Azure Web App for Containers.

## Active Branches (as of 2026-03-29)

- `main` — stable, production
- `feat/444-shoptet-hydration` — Shoptet test environment hydration feature (in progress)
- `feat/405-memory-directory` — this memory directory implementation

## Recently Completed

- Telemetry brainstorm routine (branch `claude/laughing-babbage-yeu5pw`, 2026-06-12):
  `docs/routines/telemetry-anomaly/telemetry-digest.sh` (curated App Insights KQL set →
  Markdown digest) + `docs/routines/telemetry-anomaly/README.md` (routine def) +
  updated `docs/handoff/appinsights-brainstorm-routine.md`. App Insights egress
  + read-telemetry secrets verified live. Remaining: create the scheduled
  routine in the Claude Code web UI per the routine doc.
- Shoptet test environment hydration (issue #444): added `SHOPTET_HYDRATE` env var gate, Rider launch profile, non-hardcoded storage
- MCP server: 15 tools across Catalog, Manufacturing, Batch Planning, Knowledge Base

- Frontend dead-export detector (issue #3927, PR #3932, `claude/beautiful-darwin-4uaqqg`,
  2026-08-15): added `knip` as a non-blocking frontend CI check (`frontend/knip.json`,
  `.github/workflows/ci-feature-branch.yml`). Initial backlog triaged into follow-up
  issue #3931.

- Coverage-gap fix for `UpdatePurchaseOrderInvoiceAcquiredHandler` (issue #3934,
  PR #3944, `claude/beautiful-darwin-nadsgf`, 2026-08-17): a scheduled `/plan-next-task`
  run couldn't use the AgentHarness branch-per-issue pipeline (designated-branch
  session, see `memory/gotchas/gh-cli-unavailable-in-cloud-sessions.md`), so it
  implemented the missing unit tests directly instead. Also fixed a real bug in
  `.claude/skills/_lib/gh_api.sh` (missing `Content-Type: application/json` on
  POST/PATCH) as part of the same PR.

## Pending / Known Issues

- `/plan-next-task` run (2026-08-18, cloud designated-branch session `claude/beautiful-darwin-od539d`):
  nothing to plan this cycle. All 3 open `agent`-labeled issues (#3877, #3892, #3894) already have
  open draft PRs (#3920, #3909, #3913) and are labeled `agent-completed`, but still carry the `agent`
  label too — `find_candidate.sh` correctly skips them ("already has a feature/N-* branch"), just with
  a slightly misleading reason string since these aren't actually stuck claims, they're just missing a
  label cleanup step somewhere upstream (`agent` never gets removed once `agent-completed` is added).
  Not actioned here — out of scope for this skill and not urgent. No `agent-planning` issues existed to
  reclaim either. `gh` GraphQL is blocked in this session (confirms the existing
  `memory/gotchas/gh-cli-unavailable-in-cloud-sessions.md` note) — REST reads via `gh api` and the
  `mcp__github__*` tools both worked fine.


- Memory directory (issue #405): adding cross-session knowledge accumulation — this PR
- Database migrations are manual (not automated in deployment)
- Branch `feature/meeting-mindmap`: MindMaps feature (project/workstream mind maps + Claude-rewrite
  Hangfire job with server-side edit guard) complete through Task 15 (final validation gate,
  2026-08-10). Backend build/format/tests and frontend lint/build/tests all green; zero MindMap
  test failures. Pending before it's usable end-to-end:
  1. Apply migration `AddMindMapsTables` manually to staging (`Heblo_TST`).
  2. Upload and assign the two new Entra app roles (`anela.mind_maps.read`,
     `anela.mind_maps.write`) to the Entra app registration — they currently exist only in
     `access-matrix-entra.generated.json`, which nothing consumes automatically. Without this
     every MindMaps endpoint returns 403 and the E2E scenario fails on its first click.
  3. Run `./scripts/run-playwright-tests.sh mindmaps` post-deploy to confirm the nightly E2E
     scenario (now also wired into the nightly workflow matrix).

## Key Infrastructure Notes

- CI runs: frontend Jest + backend .NET tests on PR
- Nightly: full Playwright E2E against staging
- OpenAPI TypeScript client auto-generated on `dotnet build`
- Secrets managed via local `secrets.json` (never `dotnet user-secrets set`)

Data collection:

analyze all e2e tests in @frontend/test/e2e/ and make a list in .txt file with all tests      
  which are marked skipped with a place for mark before each such test. structure uf that file  
  should look like this:   
  
  [ ] Test description 1 (file:line_number)  
  [ ] Test description 2 (file:line_number)  
  [ ] Test description 3 (file:line_number)
  
  Save this txt to @.claude/ralph_loops/fix_e2e_skipped_tests/skipped_tests_list.txt
  
  
  
Loop prompt:

Look at file @.claude/ralph_loops/fix_e2e_skipped_tests/skipped_tests_list.txt and find first line which is not marked as completed ([ ] is incomplete, [x] is completed).  

For that line, start new subagent (clear context), analyze test described (file, line number, test name). 
    In case test is invalid (UI has changed since test creation) update that test. 
    In case of missing data, use playwright to explore some test data for yourself. Then update that test to make it work.
    In case test is valid and really shows application bug, remove skip mark from that test to enable it. Write your finding to comment for that test
For running that test use @scripts/run-playwright-tests.sh script with specific test parameter. Do not run that script without test specified! (that would run all tests)
After you successfully finish with that test, mark that line as completed ([x]) in @.claude/ralph_loops/fix_e2e_skipped_tests/skipped_tests_list.txt
End your output with updated @.claude/ralph_loops/fix_e2e_skipped_tests/skipped_tests_list.txt content, close all resources you have used (background playwright procssses and scripts) and stop the session.


Output <promise>DONE</promise> when all tests are marked as completed.

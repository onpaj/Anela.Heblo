# Architecture Review: Catalog Feature
**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Reviewer:** Architecture Team  
**Feature Path:** `backend/src/Anela.Heblo.Application/features/Catalog/`

## Executive Summary

The Catalog feature is the most mature and complex module, serving as the core data aggregation layer. While it demonstrates good vertical slice architecture and caching strategies, it has critical issues with memory management in background services and lacks resilience patterns for external service calls.

**Overall Score: 7/10** - Well-structured but needs resilience and optimization improvements

## Strengths ‚úÖ

- **Proper vertical slice implementation** with clear separation of handlers, domain, and infrastructure
- **Comprehensive caching strategy** with background refresh and pre-calculated summaries
- **Multiple data source integration** (ERP, Eshop, Stock, etc.) with clean interfaces
- **Good repository pattern** with testing support

## Critical Issues üî¥

### 1. Memory Management in Background Service
```csharp
public class CatalogRefreshBackgroundService : BackgroundService
{
    // Refreshes every minute without proper memory cleanup
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1), stoppingToken);
}
```
**Risk:** Memory leak potential with continuous data refresh
**Solution:** Implement proper disposal and memory management

### 2. No Resilience Patterns
```csharp
// Direct external service calls without protection
var erpData = await _erpClient.GetDataAsync();
var eshopData = await _eshopClient.GetDataAsync();
```
**Risk:** Cascading failures when external services are down
**Solution:** Implement circuit breaker and retry patterns with Polly

### 3. Magic Numbers
```csharp
if (monthsBack >= 999) // Magic number in GetCatalogDetailHandler
{
    // Special handling for "all history"
}
```
**Solution:** Use named constants or configuration

## Moderate Issues üü°

### 1. AutoMapper Tight Coupling
```csharp
public class CatalogMappingProfile : Profile
{
    // Complex mapping logic tightly coupled to AutoMapper
}
```
**Impact:** Performance overhead and hidden complexity
**Recommendation:** Consider explicit mapping for critical paths

### 2. Empty Repository Implementations
```csharp
public class EmptyTransportBoxRepository : ITransportBoxRepository
{
    // Violates Interface Segregation Principle
}
```
**Recommendation:** Use optional interfaces or feature flags

### 3. Missing Request Validation
```csharp
public class GetCatalogDetailHandler
{
    // No validation of request parameters
    public async Task<GetCatalogDetailResponse> Handle(GetCatalogDetailRequest request, ...)
}
```
**Recommendation:** Implement FluentValidation

## Architecture Patterns

### Implemented Well ‚úÖ
- **CQRS Pattern** - Clear query handlers with no side effects
- **Repository Pattern** - Clean abstraction over data access
- **Background Service Pattern** - Async data refresh
- **Caching Pattern** - Pre-calculated summaries

### Missing/Needed ‚ùå
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - For external service calls
- **Unit of Work Pattern** - For transaction management
- **Specification Pattern** - For complex filtering logic
- **Domain Events** - For cache invalidation

## Performance Analysis

### Bottlenecks
1. **Multiple Refresh Handlers** - 12+ separate handlers for data refresh
2. **No Batch Processing** - Each handler processes individually
3. **Synchronous Cache Updates** - Blocking operations during refresh

### Recommendations
1. Implement batch refresh operations
2. Use async/parallel processing where possible
3. Add monitoring for refresh performance

## Scalability Concerns

| Issue | Impact | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| In-memory caching only | Limited by single server memory | Distributed cache (Redis) |
| No pagination in repository | Memory issues with large datasets | Database-level pagination |
| Sequential external calls | Slow refresh cycles | Parallel processing |

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** High in handlers (15+)
- **Lines per Handler:** 150-200 (should be <100)
- **Test Coverage:** Not visible but likely low
- **Coupling:** High between handlers and repository

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate (P0)
1. **Add Resilience Patterns**
```csharp
services.AddHttpClient<IErpClient>()
    .AddPolicyHandler(GetRetryPolicy())
    .AddPolicyHandler(GetCircuitBreakerPolicy());
```

2. **Fix Memory Management**
```csharp
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
{
    using var timer = new PeriodicTimer(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
    while (await timer.WaitForNextTickAsync(stoppingToken))
    {
        using var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateScope();
        // Proper scoped execution
    }
}
```

### Short-term (P1)
1. **Extract Business Logic to Domain Services**
2. **Implement Request Validation**
3. **Replace Magic Numbers with Constants**
4. **Add Telemetry and Monitoring**

### Long-term (P2)
1. **Implement Event-Driven Cache Invalidation**
2. **Move to Distributed Caching**
3. **Optimize with Database Views/Stored Procedures**
4. **Consider CQRS with Separate Read Models**

## Security Considerations

- No authorization checks on handlers
- External service credentials management unclear
- No rate limiting on refresh operations

## Testing Strategy

### Current Gaps
- No visible unit tests for handlers
- Mock repositories but no integration tests
- No performance tests for background services

### Recommended Tests
1. Unit tests for all handlers with mocked dependencies
2. Integration tests for repository implementations
3. Performance tests for background refresh
4. Resilience tests for external service failures

## Conclusion

The Catalog feature is well-architected at a high level but needs attention to operational concerns. The vertical slice architecture is properly implemented, and the caching strategy is sound. However, the lack of resilience patterns and potential memory issues in background services pose production risks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement circuit breaker for external services (1 week)
2. Refactor background service for proper memory management (3 days)
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting (1 week)
4. Extract complex handler logic to domain services (2 weeks)

**Risk Level:** Medium - Feature is functional but needs hardening for production scale

# Transport Box Management User Story

## Feature Overview
The Transport Box Management feature provides lifecycle management for shipping containers throughout the supply chain. This system tracks boxes from creation through delivery, managing inventory movements with proper state validation and complete audit trails while integrating with ERP and e-commerce systems for real-time stock synchronization.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a warehouse operator**, I want to manage transport boxes through their complete lifecycle so that I can track inventory movements accurately and maintain audit trails for compliance.

**As a receiving clerk**, I want to receive boxes from both InTransit and Reserve states so that I can process incoming shipments and reserved inventory flexibly.

**As a stock manager**, I want to prevent duplicate box codes in active states so that I can maintain data integrity across the warehouse system.

**As a compliance officer**, I want complete audit trails of all box state changes so that I can track user activities and maintain regulatory compliance.

**As a system integrator**, I want automatic stock synchronization with ERP and e-commerce systems so that inventory levels remain consistent across all platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. **Unique Code Enforcement**: System shall enforce unique box codes across all active transport boxes (excluding Closed/Error states)
3. **State Validation**: System shall prevent invalid state transitions with clear error messages
4. **Audit Trails**: System shall maintain complete audit trails of all state changes with user and timestamp tracking
5. **Item Management**: System shall track individual items within boxes with quantities and user information

### Enhanced Receiving Capabilities
6. **Flexible Receiving**: System shall allow receiving boxes from both InTransit and Reserve states
7. **State Recovery**: System shall support receiving boxes that were previously in Reserve state
8. **Automatic Code Management**: System shall automatically close conflicting boxes when reusing codes

### Data Integrity & Error Handling
9. **Error Recovery**: System shall support comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms  
10. **Positive Quantities**: System shall validate that all item amounts are positive values
11. **Required Fields**: System shall enforce required fields (product codes, names, user information)

### Integration Requirements
12. **ERP Synchronization**: System shall synchronize stock levels with ERP systems in real-time
13. **E-commerce Integration**: System shall update e-commerce platform inventory levels
14. **External System Resilience**: System shall handle integration failures gracefully with retry mechanisms

## Business Flow

### Core Box Lifecycle
1. **New**: Empty box created in system
2. **Opened**: Box assigned unique code and ready for item management  
3. **InTransit**: Box shipped with tracking information
4. **Received**: Box arrived at destination (can transition from InTransit OR Reserve)
5. **Stocked**: Items added to inventory and available for picking
6. **Closed**: Box lifecycle completed and archived

### Reserve Flow  
1. **Reserve**: Items held for specific orders (accessible from Opened state)
2. **Received**: Reserved items can be received directly (bypassing InTransit)

### Error Handling
- **Error**: Terminal state for boxes with unrecoverable issues (accessible from any state)

## Updated State Transitions

### Allowed State Transitions
- **New** → Opened, Closed
- **Opened** → InTransit, Reserve, New (reset)  
- **InTransit** → Received, Opened (revert)
- **Reserve** → Received, Opened (revert)
- **Received** → Stocked, Closed
- **Stocked** → Closed
- **Any State** → Error

### Removed Transitions
- ❌ **InSwap state removed completely** (no swap operations supported)
- ❌ **ToSwap/ToPick operations removed** (simplified stocking process)
- ❌ **Swap-related state validations removed**

## Business Rules

### Code Management
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate codes allowed in active states (New, Opened, InTransit, Received, Reserve)
- **Auto-Closure**: System automatically closes existing Stocked boxes when reusing their code
- **Code Assignment**: Codes assigned during box opening and remain immutable
- **Validation**: Code required for transit and reserve operations

### State Constraints
- **Item Management**: Items can only be added/removed in Opened state
- **Transit Requirements**: Boxes must contain items to transition to InTransit
- **Receive Sources**: Boxes can be received from InTransit OR Reserve states
- **Terminal States**: Closed and Error are final states with no outbound transitions

### Audit & Compliance
- **User Tracking**: All state changes must record user identity and timestamp
- **State History**: Complete state transition log maintained for each box
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Audit trail format suitable for compliance reporting
- **Data Retention**: Historical data preserved according to regulatory requirements
